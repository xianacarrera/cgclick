        "descriptionBefore": "Vietnamese-born computer graphics researcher Bui Tuong Phong invented both of these very important techniques. His reflection model describes how much light a surface reflects based on the properties of said surface - the idea is to calculate three types of reflection (ambient, diffuse and specular) and then add them up. The Phong shading, on the other hand, is an algorithm which uses interpolation of geometry information to make polygonal surfaces look smoother.",

The vertex shader is responsible for transformations in space, for example, and its code is executed for each vertex (important point) in the scene. The fragment shader's job is to figure out what color each pixel should have. You can directly edit both of these shaders, choose which values to pass to them and see the results.",
