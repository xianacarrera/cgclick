# cg.click

## Project Mission
* For teachers of computer graphics who want to make their presentations more interactive (and their students). cg.click is a web application that allows teachers to create customizable presentations using pre-prepared slides, interactive renderings (pictures) and questions. Unlike courses where everyone is only watching the teacher's presentation, with cg.click the students are more involved in the lecture and can experiment with the topic on their own. A wise man once said: *"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."* Our project aims to help students understand computer graphics by involving them.
