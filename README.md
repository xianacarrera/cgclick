# cg.click

## Project idea
Implement something like asq.click but for a computer graphics course
* Teacher/student roles.
* Student browsers are synced with the teacher's but not with one another's - so students can try different inputs for rendering/rasterization.
* Authentification for the teacher (possible use of crypto libraries).
* Tangible pictures - changing coefficients, rotations.
* Rasterization/rendering (possible use of WebGL).

## Participants
* Xiana Carrera Alonso
* Marie Kalousková
* Jiří Heller
